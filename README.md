# API Resource Generator
- This is a rake task for Ruby on Rails to create API resources(Controller, View, RSpec) automatically.
- I careated it because I needed to copy & past and rewrite whole api version on resources when I created new API version resources.
- Please copy & past `main.rake` to your Rails application (/lib/tasks/api.rake) when you use it.
  - e.g. `bin/rake api_resource_generator:generate API=2`
